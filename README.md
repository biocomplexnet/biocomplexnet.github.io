The hotel has multiple rooms however there are no single rooms available. The suggested room is a 2 bed-1 bath for one, two or more people (up to 4). If you're traveling alone and interested in the possibility of sharing a room with another attendee, please inform us at the registration form.

# Scientific Program & Workshops

It is desirable for every participant to present their scientific work. This is an excellent opportunity to share your scientific expertise and connect with people interested in your topic. If you're a member of the Bioinformatics & Complex Networks Lab, your presentation is mandatory. 

We have two kinds of talks: 

- **Regular talk:** 10 minutes talk + 5 minutes questions
- **Key talk (1 to 2 per day):** 25 minutes talk + 5 minutes questions 

A meaningful (*preliminary*) title should be given during registration to schedule talk sessions. As expected, we will provide a video projector (with VGA & HDMI ports) and a laser pointer for the presentations. 

Preliminary schedule of our scientific program. *Definitive information on the schedule will be given soon.*
