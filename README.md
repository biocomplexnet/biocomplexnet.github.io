The hotel has multiple rooms. The suggested room is a 2 bed-1 bath.

# Scientific Program

It is desirable for every participant to present their scientific work. This is not a burden but an excellent opportunity to share your scientific expertise to connect with people interested in your topic. Your presentation is mandatory if you're a member of the Bioinformatics & Complex Networks Lab. We will have two kinds of talks: 

- **Regular talk:** 10 minutes talk + 5 minutes questions

- **Key talk (1 to 2 per day):** 25 minutes talk + 5 minutes questions 

A meaningful (preliminary) title should be given during registration to schedule talk sessions. As expected, we will provide a video projector (with VGA & HDMI ports) and a laser pointer for the presentations. 

This is a preliminary schedule of our scientific program. *Definitive information on the schedule will be given at time.*
